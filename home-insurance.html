        <h2>Michigan Home Insurance: What You Need to Know</h2>
        <p>Michigan law does not require homeowners insurance, but <strong>your mortgage lender almost certainly does</strong>. If your coverage lapses, your lender will place a force-placed policy on your home — typically at a much higher cost with less coverage. Even if you own your home outright, homeowners insurance protects your largest financial asset from weather damage, fire, theft, and liability claims.</p>

        <h3>Michigan Weather Risks</h3>
        <p>Michigan homeowners face a range of weather-related risks throughout the year. A standard HO-3 policy covers most of them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tornadoes and windstorms</strong> — Southeast Michigan averages several tornado warnings per year; high winds can damage roofs, siding, and trees</li>
          <li><strong>Hail</strong> — hailstorms cause roof, gutter, and siding damage, often requiring full replacement</li>
          <li><strong>Ice dams</strong> — ice buildup at the roof edge forces water under shingles and into your home</li>
          <li><strong>Frozen pipes</strong> — Michigan winters regularly drop below zero, putting uninsulated pipes at risk of bursting</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy snow</strong> — accumulated snow loads can cause roof damage, especially on older homes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Standard Policies Don't Cover</h3>
        <p>While an HO-3 policy is broad, some common Michigan risks require separate coverage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flood</strong> — requires a separate policy through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private flood insurer</li>
          <li><strong>Sewer and water backup</strong> — requires an endorsement added to your policy. <strong>This is critical for the Downriver area</strong>, where aging municipal sewer infrastructure increases backup risk</li>
          <li><strong>Earthquake</strong> — rare in Michigan but not covered under standard policies; separate coverage is available</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Home Insurance Coverage We Offer</h2>
        <p>We tailor your homeowners policy from a full range of coverage options. Here's what's included in a standard policy:</p>

        <div class="coverage-grid">
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Dwelling Coverage (A)</h3>
            <p>Covers the cost to repair or rebuild your home's structure — walls, roof, floors, built-in appliances, and attached features like a garage or deck. Your dwelling limit should equal the full replacement cost of your home.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Other Structures (B)</h3>
            <p>Protects detached structures on your property — a separate garage, shed, fence, or gazebo. Typically set at 10% of your dwelling coverage, but can be increased if needed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Personal Property (C)</h3>
            <p>Covers your belongings — furniture, electronics, clothing, and appliances — if damaged, destroyed, or stolen. We recommend replacement cost coverage so you receive the full cost to replace items without depreciation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Liability Protection (E)</h3>
            <p>Pays for legal defense and damages if someone is injured on your property or you accidentally cause damage to someone else's property. Standard limits start at $100,000, but we often recommend $300,000 or higher.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Loss of Use (D)</h3>
            <p>Covers additional living expenses — hotel, meals, and other costs — if a covered loss makes your home uninhabitable while it's being repaired or rebuilt.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Medical Payments (F)</h3>
            <p>Pays for minor medical expenses if a guest is injured on your property, regardless of fault. Covers costs like emergency room visits and first aid — without the need for a lawsuit.</p>
          </div>

      </section>

      <!-- 5. Cost Section -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>How Much Does Home Insurance Cost in Michigan?</h2>
        <p>Michigan homeowners pay an average of approximately <strong>$2,200 to $2,400 per year</strong> for a standard policy on a $250,000–$300,000 home — roughly in line with the national average. However, rates have increased approximately <strong>21% in 2024–2025</strong> due to rising construction costs and more frequent severe weather claims.</p>
        <p>Your actual premium depends on several factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Home value and replacement cost</strong> — higher dwelling coverage means a higher premium</li>
          <li><strong>Home age and condition</strong> — older homes with outdated electrical, plumbing, or roofing cost more to insure</li>
          <li><strong>Location</strong> — proximity to fire stations, hydrants, and flood zones affects your rate</li>
          <li><strong>Roof condition and age</strong> — a newer roof can significantly lower your premium</li>
          <li><strong>Claims history</strong> — past claims on the property (checked via CLUE report) increase rates</li>
          <li><strong>Credit history</strong> — Michigan insurers use credit-based insurance scores in pricing</li>
          <li><strong>Deductible</strong> — a higher deductible lowers your premium</li>
          <li><strong>Construction type</strong> — frame, brick, or masonry affects rebuild cost and risk</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Bundle and save:</strong> Combining home and auto insurance with the same carrier typically saves <strong>18–30%</strong> on your combined premiums. It's one of the easiest ways to lower your overall insurance costs.</p>

        <p>Even though Michigan doesn't legally require homeowners insurance, most homeowners need it. Here's who should have coverage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mortgage holders</strong> — your lender requires homeowners insurance as a condition of your loan. If your policy lapses, the lender will place force-placed insurance on your home at a much higher cost</li>
          <li><strong>New homebuyers</strong> — you'll need proof of insurance before closing on your home. We can have your policy ready before settlement day</li>
          <li><strong>Homeowners without a mortgage</strong> — your home is likely your largest asset. Insurance protects against fire, storms, theft, and liability claims that could wipe out your equity</li>
          <li><strong>Condo owners</strong> — an HO-6 policy covers your unit's interior, personal property, and liability. Your condo association's master policy only covers the building's common areas and exterior</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Home Insurance</h2>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What does homeowners insurance cover in Michigan?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>A standard Michigan homeowners insurance policy (HO-3) covers your dwelling, other structures (garage, fence, shed), personal property, liability, loss of use (additional living expenses if your home is uninhabitable), and medical payments to others. It protects against perils like fire, windstorms, hail, theft, vandalism, and certain water damage. Flood and sewer backup require separate coverage.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How much home insurance do I need?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Your dwelling coverage (Coverage A) should equal the full replacement cost of your home — the amount it would cost to rebuild from the ground up at today's construction prices. This is different from your home's market value or purchase price. Our team can help you estimate the correct replacement cost based on your home's size, construction type, and features.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does homeowners insurance cover flooding?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. If your home is in or near a flood zone, you need a separate flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private flood insurer. Even homes outside designated flood zones can experience flooding — over 25% of flood claims come from low-to-moderate risk areas. <a href="#quote">Contact us</a> to learn about flood insurance options.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does home insurance cover sewer and water backup?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Sewer and water backup is not covered under a standard homeowners policy. You need to add a sewer and water backup endorsement, which typically costs $50 to $100 per year. This is especially important in the Downriver area, where aging municipal sewer infrastructure increases backup risk. We strongly recommend this endorsement for every homeowner we work with.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What's the difference between replacement cost and actual cash value?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Replacement cost pays to repair or rebuild your home and replace belongings at today's prices with no deduction for depreciation. Actual cash value (ACV) pays replacement cost minus depreciation, meaning you receive less for older items. Replacement cost coverage costs more but provides significantly better protection, especially for your dwelling and high-value belongings.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How can I lower my home insurance premium?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Several strategies can reduce your Michigan home insurance costs: bundle home and auto policies for a multi-policy discount (saving 18–30%), raise your deductible, install security and fire alarm systems, update your roof, electrical, and plumbing, maintain a claims-free history, and work with an independent agent who can compare rates from multiple carriers.</p>

            <summary>Can I bundle home and auto insurance to save money?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Bundling home and auto insurance with the same carrier typically saves 18% to 30% on your combined premiums. At Awad Insurance, we compare bundled rates from multiple carriers to find the best combination of coverage and savings for your household.</p>
