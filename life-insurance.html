        <h3>Why Life Insurance Matters for Michigan Families</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mortgage protection</strong> — the average Michigan home costs approximately $230,000; life insurance can pay off the mortgage so your family keeps the home</li>
          <li><strong>Income replacement</strong> — replace the income your family depends on for everyday expenses, childcare, and savings</li>
          <li><strong>Final expenses</strong> — the average funeral costs $8,000 to $12,000, a burden your family shouldn't face during a difficult time</li>
          <li><strong>Debt protection</strong> — prevent your spouse or co-signers from inheriting outstanding debts</li>
          <li><strong>Cost of living</strong> — Michigan families face rising costs for housing, healthcare, and education that make financial protection essential</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Michigan-Specific Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No state income tax on proceeds</strong> — life insurance death benefits are not subject to Michigan state income tax</li>
          <li><strong>Michigan estate tax repealed</strong> — no state-level estate tax on life insurance proceeds (federal exemption still applies)</li>
          <li><strong>Employer coverage often insufficient</strong> — group life insurance through your employer is typically only 1 to 2 times your annual salary, far less than most families need</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 4. Coverage Types Breakdown -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>Life Insurance Coverage We Offer</h2>
        <p>We help you choose from a full range of life insurance options to match your family's needs and budget:</p>

        <div class="coverage-grid">
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Term Life Insurance</h3>
            <p>The most affordable option. Provides coverage for a set period — 10, 20, or 30 years — with a fixed premium and guaranteed death benefit. Ideal for covering a mortgage, raising children, or replacing income during your working years.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Whole Life Insurance</h3>
            <p>Lifetime coverage that never expires. Builds guaranteed cash value over time, has fixed premiums that never increase, and provides a guaranteed death benefit. A good fit for lifelong protection and estate planning.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Universal Life Insurance</h3>
            <p>Flexible permanent coverage that lets you adjust your premiums and death benefit as your needs change. Accumulates cash value based on current interest rates. Combines lifelong protection with financial flexibility.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Final Expense / Burial Insurance</h3>
            <p>A smaller whole life policy designed to cover funeral costs, medical bills, and other end-of-life expenses. Features simplified underwriting and lower face amounts — typically $5,000 to $25,000 — making it accessible for older applicants.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Child Life Insurance</h3>
            <p>Small, affordable policies that cover your child and lock in their insurability for the future — regardless of health changes later in life. Many policies build cash value that your child can access as an adult.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Group / Employer Supplemental</h3>
            <p>Supplement your employer's group life insurance with a personal policy. Employer coverage typically ends when you leave the job and may not be enough to fully protect your family. A supplemental policy fills the gap.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- 5. Cost Section -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>How Much Does Life Insurance Cost?</h2>
        <p>Life insurance is more affordable than most people think. A healthy 30-year-old can get a <strong>$500,000 20-year term policy for roughly $20 to $30 per month</strong>. Whole life insurance costs 5 to 15 times more than term for the same death benefit, but it provides lifetime coverage and builds cash value.</p>
        <p>Your premium depends on several factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Age</strong> — the single biggest factor; every year you wait costs more</li>
          <li><strong>Health</strong> — medical history, current conditions, and exam results affect your rate</li>
          <li><strong>Smoking status</strong> — smokers pay significantly higher premiums (often 2 to 3 times more)</li>
          <li><strong>Coverage amount</strong> — higher death benefits cost more</li>
          <li><strong>Term length</strong> — longer terms (30-year vs. 10-year) have higher premiums</li>
          <li><strong>Policy type</strong> — term is the most affordable; whole life and universal life cost more</li>
          <li><strong>Family medical history</strong> — hereditary conditions can impact your rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rates increase with age, so the best time to buy is now. We compare quotes from multiple carriers to find the most competitive rate for your situation.</p>

      <!-- 6. Who Needs It -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>Who Needs Life Insurance?</h2>
        <p>If anyone depends on you financially — or would be affected by your absence — life insurance is worth considering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Parents and breadwinners</strong> — replace the income your family depends on for housing, food, childcare, and daily expenses</li>
          <li><strong>Homeowners with a mortgage</strong> — pay off the mortgage so your family keeps the home without financial strain</li>
          <li><strong>Couples with shared debt</strong> — protect your spouse from inheriting student loans, car loans, or credit card balances</li>
          <li><strong>Business owners</strong> — fund buy-sell agreements, cover key person losses, and ensure business succession</li>
          <li><strong>Stay-at-home parents</strong> — replace the value of childcare, household management, and other services worth $30,000 to $40,000 or more per year</li>
          <li><strong>Young adults</strong> — lock in the lowest possible rates while you're young and healthy, before life changes make coverage more expensive</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="faq-list">
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How much life insurance do I need?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>A common guideline is 10 to 15 times your annual income, but the right amount depends on your specific situation — your mortgage balance, outstanding debts, number of dependents, future education costs, and your spouse's income. Our team can help you calculate the coverage amount that fully protects your family.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Term life insurance covers you for a set period (10, 20, or 30 years) and pays a death benefit if you pass away during that term. It's the most affordable option. Whole life insurance covers you for your entire lifetime, builds cash value over time, and has fixed premiums — but costs 5 to 15 times more than term for the same death benefit. The right choice depends on your goals and budget.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>At what age should I buy life insurance?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best time to buy life insurance is when you're young and healthy. Premiums are based primarily on age and health, so every year you wait increases your cost. Many people purchase their first policy in their 20s or 30s — especially after getting married, buying a home, or having children.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do I need life insurance if I have coverage through my employer?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Employer group life insurance is a good starting point, but it's usually only 1 to 2 times your annual salary — far less than most families need. It also ends when you leave the job. A personal policy ensures continuous coverage at a locked-in rate regardless of employment changes.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I get life insurance with a pre-existing health condition?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Many carriers offer coverage for people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or a history of cancer. Your premiums may be higher, and some policy types (like guaranteed issue or simplified issue) don't require a medical exam. As an independent agency, Awad Insurance can shop multiple carriers to find the best option for your health profile.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How do I name beneficiaries on my life insurance policy?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>You can name one or more primary beneficiaries and contingent (backup) beneficiaries on your policy. Beneficiaries can be individuals, trusts, or organizations. It's important to review and update your beneficiaries after major life events like marriage, divorce, or the birth of a child. Our team can walk you through the process.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is life insurance taxable in Michigan?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In most cases, life insurance death benefits are not subject to federal or Michigan state income tax. Michigan repealed its estate tax, so there's no state-level estate tax on life insurance proceeds either. However, if the policy earns interest before being paid out, that interest may be taxable. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>
