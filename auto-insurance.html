      <!-- 3. Michigan-Specific Requirements -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>Michigan Auto Insurance Requirements</h2>
        <p>Michigan is a <strong>no-fault state</strong>, meaning your own insurance company pays for your injuries and certain losses after an accident, regardless of who was at fault. State law requires every registered vehicle to carry three types of coverage:</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Coverage Type</th>
                <th>Minimum Required</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Personal Injury Protection (PIP)</strong></td>
                <td>Choose from 6 levels (see below)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Property Protection Insurance (PPI)</strong></td>
                <td>$1,000,000</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Bodily Injury Liability</strong></td>
                <td>$250,000 / $500,000 *</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Property Damage Liability</strong></td>
                <td>$10,000 (out-of-state damage)</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p style="font-size:13px;color:#777;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:0;">* Drivers may choose lower limits of $50,000/$100,000 by signing a waiver through the Michigan DIFS.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>PIP Coverage Levels After the 2019 Reform</h3>
        <p>Michigan's <strong>2019 No-Fault Reform</strong> (effective July 2020) ended the state's requirement for unlimited lifetime PIP medical benefits. Drivers now choose from six PIP medical coverage levels:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Unlimited</strong> — lifetime PIP medical coverage (the pre-reform default)</li>
          <li><strong>$500,000</strong> per person, per accident</li>
          <li><strong>$250,000</strong> per person, per accident</li>
          <li><strong>$50,000</strong> per person, per accident — available only to <strong>Medicaid enrollees</strong></li>
          <li><strong>$250,000 with health coverage coordination</strong> — available only to drivers with qualifying health insurance that covers auto injuries</li>
          <li><strong>Opt-out</strong> (no PIP medical) — available only to drivers enrolled in <strong>Medicare Parts A and B</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Choosing the right PIP level is one of the most important decisions Michigan drivers make. A lower level reduces your premium, but it also limits your medical coverage after a serious accident. We help you evaluate the trade-offs based on your health insurance and financial situation.</p>

            <h3>Bodily Injury Liability</h3>
            <p>Pays for injuries you cause to others in an at-fault accident, including medical expenses, lost wages, and legal defense costs. Michigan's default minimums are $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident.</p>

            <h3>Property Damage Liability</h3>

            <h3>Rental Reimbursement</h3>

      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>How Much Does Auto Insurance Cost in Michigan?</h2>
        <p>Michigan is one of the more expensive states for auto insurance. Drivers pay an average of approximately <strong>$3,000 to $3,200 per year</strong> for full coverage — compared to the national average of about $2,150. However, the 2019 PIP reform has helped many drivers reduce their premiums by choosing a lower PIP level.</p>
        <p>Your actual premium depends on several factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Age and driving experience</strong> — younger and newer drivers typically pay more</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle type</strong> — newer, more expensive cars cost more to insure</li>
          <li><strong>Driving record</strong> — accidents and tickets increase your rate</li>
          <li><strong>Credit history</strong> — Michigan insurers use credit-based insurance scores</li>
          <li><strong>Coverage level</strong> — higher limits and lower deductibles raise your premium</li>
          <li><strong>PIP choice</strong> — unlimited PIP costs significantly more than $250,000 or $500,000</li>
          <li><strong>Location</strong> — urban areas generally have higher rates than rural areas</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>New car buyers</strong> — lenders require collision and comprehensive coverage on financed vehicles</li>
          <li><strong>Families with teen drivers</strong> — adding a young driver impacts your premium; we find discounts to keep costs manageable</li>
          <li><strong>Daily commuters</strong> — more time on the road means more exposure; make sure your liability limits are adequate</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-vehicle households</strong> — insuring all vehicles on one policy often qualifies for a multi-car discount</li>
        </ul>

            <summary>What are Michigan's no-fault auto insurance requirements?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Michigan requires three types of auto insurance: Personal Injury Protection (PIP), Property Protection Insurance ($1 million), and Residual Bodily Injury Liability. The default bodily injury minimums are $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident, though drivers can opt for lower limits of $50,000/$100,000 by signing a waiver. Michigan's no-fault system means your own insurer pays for your injuries regardless of who caused the accident.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How much does car insurance cost in Michigan?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Michigan drivers pay an average of approximately $3,000 to $3,200 per year for full coverage, which is higher than the national average. Your actual premium depends on your age, driving record, vehicle, PIP coverage level, credit history, and chosen deductibles. The 2019 PIP reform has helped many Michigan drivers lower their premiums. <a href="#quote">Get a free quote</a> to find your personalized rate.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What PIP coverage level should I choose after the 2019 reform?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The right PIP level depends on your health insurance and financial situation. Michigan's reform offers six options: unlimited, $500,000, $250,000, $50,000 (Medicaid only), $250,000 with health coverage coordination, and opt-out (Medicare only). Lower PIP levels reduce your premium but limit your medical coverage after a serious accident. We recommend speaking with an agent to evaluate the trade-offs for your specific situation.</p>

          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What's the difference between comprehensive and collision coverage?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Collision coverage pays for damage to your car from an accident with another vehicle or object, regardless of fault. Comprehensive coverage pays for non-collision damage — theft, vandalism, weather events, animal strikes, and falling objects. Together, they provide full physical damage protection for your vehicle. Both are optional under Michigan law but typically required by lenders on financed vehicles.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How can I lower my auto insurance premium?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Several strategies can reduce your Michigan auto insurance costs: bundle auto and home policies for a multi-policy discount, raise your deductibles, choose a lower PIP coverage level if appropriate, maintain a clean driving record, ask about available discounts (good student, multi-vehicle, safe driver, anti-theft device), and work with an independent agent who can compare rates from multiple carriers.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does my auto insurance cover rental cars?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In most cases, your Michigan auto insurance policy extends to rental cars within the United States. Your liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage typically apply. However, rental reimbursement coverage — which pays for a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired after a covered claim — is a separate optional add-on. Check your policy or ask our team for details.</p>

            <summary>Can I bundle auto and home insurance to save money?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Bundling auto and home insurance with the same carrier often results in a multi-policy discount of 5% to 25%. At Awad Insurance, we compare bundled rates from multiple carriers to find the best combination of coverage and savings for your household. Even if you rent, bundling auto with renters insurance can qualify you for a discount.</p>
