If you're found liable for a judgment that exceeds your policy limits and your assets, courts can garnish your wages for years.

        <h3>Why Michigan Residents Need Umbrella Coverage</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No-fault auto has limits</strong> — Michigan's no-fault system doesn't protect you from liability lawsuits when someone suffers a serious impairment, and Wayne County jury verdicts often exceed $500,000</li>
          <li><strong>High litigation environment</strong> — Michigan courts see large personal injury awards that can far exceed standard policy limits</li>
          <li><strong>Standard policy gaps</strong> — homeowners and auto policies typically don't cover libel, slander, defamation, or false arrest claims</li>
          <li><strong>Asset protection</strong> — savings, home equity, retirement accounts, and future wages are all at risk if a judgment exceeds your liability limits</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Michigan-Specific Liability Risks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No-fault threshold lawsuits</strong> — Michigan allows lawsuits for "serious impairment of body function," which can result in large judgments well beyond standard auto liability limits</li>
          <li><strong>Premises liability</strong> — harsh Michigan winters create constant slip-and-fall exposure on sidewalks, driveways, and stoops</li>
          <li><strong>Dog bite strict liability</strong> — Michigan law holds dog owners liable regardless of the dog's prior history, and dog bite claims routinely exceed $50,000</li>
          <li><strong>Watercraft and recreational vehicles</strong> — boats, jet skis, ATVs, and snowmobiles are common in the Downriver area and create additional liability exposure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Umbrella Insurance Coverage We Offer</h2>
        <p>We help you build an umbrella policy that extends your protection across every area of exposure:</p>

          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Excess Auto Liability</h3>
            <p>Pays the difference when accident damages exceed your auto liability cap. If a serious accident produces a $750,000 judgment and your auto policy covers $500,000, your umbrella pays the remaining $250,000.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Excess Homeowners Liability</h3>
            <p>Covers slip-and-fall injuries, dog bites, and guest accidents that exceed your homeowners policy limit. Protects your home equity and personal assets when a claim goes beyond standard coverage.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Landlord Liability</h3>
            <p>Covers tenant and visitor injuries at your rental properties above your landlord policy limit. Essential for Downriver property owners with one or more rental units.</p>

          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Personal Injury Protection</h3>
            <p>Covers libel, slander, defamation, false arrest, wrongful eviction, and invasion of privacy — claims that are typically excluded by standard homeowners and auto policies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Legal Defense Costs</h3>
            <p>Covers attorney fees and court costs when you're sued. Legal defense costs typically don't reduce your umbrella policy limit, so your full coverage amount remains available for the judgment or settlement.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="coverage-card">
            <h3>Worldwide Coverage</h3>
            <p>Your umbrella policy protects you anywhere in the world, not just in Michigan. Whether you're traveling, vacationing, or living abroad temporarily, your liability protection goes with you.</p>

      <!-- 5. Cost Section -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>How Much Does Umbrella Insurance Cost in Michigan?</h2>
        <p>Umbrella insurance is one of the most affordable types of coverage available. Here are typical annual costs in Michigan:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$1 million coverage</strong> — $150 to $300 per year</li>
          <li><strong>$2 million coverage</strong> — $225 to $400 per year</li>
          <li><strong>Each additional $1 million</strong> — approximately $75 to $100 per year</li>
          <li><strong>$5 million coverage</strong> — $400 to $700 per year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Several factors affect your premium:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Number of underlying policies</strong> — more cars, properties, and watercraft increase your exposure</li>
          <li><strong>Driving record</strong> — a clean driving history keeps premiums lower</li>
          <li><strong>Claims history</strong> — prior liability claims can increase your rate</li>
          <li><strong>Coverage amount</strong> — higher limits cost more, but the per-million cost decreases as you add coverage</li>

      <!-- 6. Who Needs It -->
      <section class="service-section">
        <h2>Who Needs Umbrella Insurance in Michigan?</h2>
        <p>Umbrella insurance makes sense for more people than you might think:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Homeowners</strong> — your home equity is one of your biggest assets, and a single lawsuit can exceed your homeowners liability limit</li>
          <li><strong>Anyone with assets above their liability limits</strong> — savings, investments, retirement accounts, and future earnings are all exposed if a judgment exceeds your policy limits</li>
          <li><strong>Landlords</strong> — tenant and visitor injuries at rental properties can produce claims that exceed your landlord policy's liability coverage</li>
          <li><strong>Parents of teen drivers</strong> — teen drivers are statistically the most likely to cause accidents, and parents are financially responsible for the damages</li>
          <li><strong>Public-facing professionals</strong> — coaches, volunteers, board members, and social media creators face elevated defamation and personal injury risk</li>
          <li><strong>Business owners wanting personal protection</strong> — commercial insurance covers your business, but your personal assets can still be targeted in lawsuits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Umbrella Insurance</h2>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is umbrella insurance and how does it work?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Umbrella insurance is a type of personal liability insurance that provides an extra layer of protection above the limits of your existing auto, home, and other policies. When a claim exceeds the liability limit of your underlying policy, your umbrella policy kicks in to cover the difference. It also covers certain claims that standard policies exclude, such as libel, slander, and defamation.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How much umbrella insurance do I need?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>A common guideline is to carry umbrella coverage equal to your net worth, including your home equity, savings, investments, retirement accounts, and future earning potential. Most families start with $1 million in coverage. If you have significant assets, rental properties, teen drivers, or other elevated risk factors, you may want $2 million or more.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does umbrella insurance cover me if I'm sued?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Umbrella insurance covers both the legal defense costs (attorney fees and court costs) and any judgment or settlement amount that exceeds your underlying policy limits. In most cases, legal defense costs do not reduce your umbrella policy limit, giving you full protection for both the lawsuit and the payout.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What does umbrella insurance NOT cover?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Umbrella insurance does not cover damage to your own property, your own injuries, intentional acts or criminal behavior, business liability (which requires a separate commercial policy), or contractual obligations you've agreed to. It is strictly a liability policy that protects you when others hold you responsible for their injuries or damages.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do I need to increase my existing policy limits before buying umbrella insurance?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Most carriers require minimum underlying liability limits before they will issue an umbrella policy. Typical requirements are $250,000/$500,000 for auto liability and $300,000 for homeowners liability. If your current limits are lower, our team can adjust them as part of the umbrella quoting process.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is umbrella insurance worth it if I don't have a high net worth?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Umbrella insurance doesn't just protect current assets — it also protects your future earnings. If you're found liable for a judgment that exceeds your policy limits and your assets, courts can garnish your wages for years. At $150 to $300 per year for $1 million in coverage, umbrella insurance is one of the most affordable ways to protect your financial future.</p>
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I bundle umbrella insurance with my auto and home policies?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. Bundling your umbrella with your auto and home insurance is often the most cost-effective approach. Many carriers offer multi-policy discounts, and bundling ensures seamless coordination between your underlying policies and your umbrella coverage. Our team can quote everything together to maximize savings.</p>
